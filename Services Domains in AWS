Different services in AWS:
  1) compute
  2) storage
  3) database
  4) security
  5) management
  6) customer engagement
  7) App integration

1) Compute Domain:
    AWS EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Autoscaling, 
    AWS LoadBalancer, AWS ECR, AWS ECS.
    
  1) AWS EC2: Elastic compute cloud is one of the integral parts of the  aws ecosystme. EC2 enables on-demand,
  scalabale computing capacity in the aws coud.
  -Its basically a raw server that is given to you. You can do anything, make a web server or a operating system etc...you can make a ram of your choice, type of os
  like linux or windows etc..
  
  2) Elastic beanstack: you can quiclky deploy and manage applications in the aws cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure
  that runs those applications.In AWS EC2 you can make it to anything, you can make it a web server, install softwares, make database server. But whereas elastic beanstack 
  has some restrictions, it is lonely a web application server, you cannot install any softwares.
  -AWS ec2 is a infrastructure as a service whereas elastic beanstack is a platform as a service. Everything is pre configured in elastic beanstack.
  -it is used to quickly deplay web applications.
  - It will host an application but only you can on;y deploy web apps quickly. You can import your websites from local or you can start designing from scratch as well.
  But in EC2 you can do anything.
  
  3) AWS Lambda: It is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
    -It is a advanced version of EC2. you can deploy an application in it or you cannot host an application in it.
    -It is used for processing the backend code.
    - It will not host an applicatoin
  
  4) AWS Elastic LoadBalancer: It distributes incomeing application or network traffic accross multiple targets such as amazon EC2 instances, containers, and all IP addresses in multiple
  availability Zones.
  -Its basically keeps track of the activity of the severs. If a server is unhealthy it stops transfering server traffic to that server and sned to other healthy server
  until it cools down. This is the main job of the Loadbalancer.
  -For eg: If there are three servers in which the trafiic is distributed if all the three severs are healthy and working fine the loadbalancer will distributes
  the traffic equally among all the three services. But if there is any overload in one of the server the loabalancer will stops sending the traffic to that server 
  and diverts it to the other two server until it cools downs.
  -If we wonder how can we decide how how much traffic is coming to deploy accordingly to servers, then the next service will comes into play which is AWS auto scaling
  
  5) AWS Auto Scaling: Monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possoble cost.
  -So basically it mainatins the track of how much traffic is incoming and how to handle them by distributing the load to different instances.
  -If the incoming traffic is going beyond 80% then the auto scaling automatically deploys additional instances to takecare of the extra load. At the same time if 
  the incoming traffic is below 40%, it decreases the instances and allot them to other resources or keep them in idle mode.
  
  6) AWS Elastic container registry(ECR): It is a fully managed docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage and deploy docker 
  container images.
  -Basically a docker is a tool which stores many conatiners at one place, where each container is a virtual machine with separate operating system with min size
  of 40MB. So to store these containers ECr sevres as a docker conatiner which hold all these containers at one place. Suppose if there is a windoes operating system
  with 40mb in size conatiner this will be stored in ECR. But if you want to run this conatiner there is another service called ECS( Amazon Elastic service).
  
  7) Amazon ECS(amazon elastic container service): It is highly scalable,high performance orchestartion service that supports docker containers and allows you to 
   easily run and sacle containerized applications on AWS.
   -It basically runs these conatiners whenever necassary and if there is anything wrong with this container it relaunches it again.
